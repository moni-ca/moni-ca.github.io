                <h2>Short Task Assignment</h2>
                    <p>This assignment will be the beginning of my Meetup Report. No worries! There is more to come
                        to fulfill the MeetUp assignment.
                <h2>Women Who Code: Javascript</h2>
                    <p> Women Who Code is a meetup that takes place weekly after work hours. It's for anyone who identifies as a woman.
                        The purpose of the meetup is to provide a space for women to gather and work on their side projects 
                        while providing each other with help whenever needed. </p>
                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                    <p> This past Tuesday, I attended the Women Who Code MeetUp at Mixpanel after work and learned some Javascript. 
                        I entered Mixpanel and was greeted by the front desk worker. He sent me to the designated floor where 
                        the meetup gathers. When I got to the floor, there was another front desk person who greeted me and led 
                        the meetup gathering. Her name was Michelle and she is an engineer at Mixpanel. She briefly showed me around
                        and gave me a run down as to what the agenda usually is at this meetup. Then she pointed out the room
                        where all of the women were working in.
